---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free at github.com)
- Vercel account (free at vercel.com) OR Netlify account (free at netlify.com)

---

## ✅ Step 1: Prepare Your Local Repository

### Initialize Git (if not already done)

## 🔧 Step 2: Push to GitHub

### Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a repository named `bible-word-weaver`
3. **Do NOT** initialize with README, gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bible-word-weaver.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 📊 Step 7: Set Up Analytics (Optional)

### Add Google Analytics

1. Create Google Analytics 4 property at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Get your Measurement ID

  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment (Auto Updates)

Once set up with Vercel/Netlify:

1. Make changes to files locally
2. Commit: `git commit -m "Your message"`
3. Push: `git push`
4. Vercel/Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys within seconds!

No more manual deployment needed! ✨

---

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

1. Check build logs in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
2. Ensure all files are in the root directory
3. Verify no syntax errors in HTML

### Game doesn't work on live site

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Common issues:
   - File paths are case-sensitive on servers
   - localStorage works differently on some servers

### Daily limit not persisting

- This is expected - localStorage is per-domain
- Each user has their own daily limit on their device
- This is working as designed!

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Collect feedback from users
2. ✅ Monitor analytics
3. ✅ Fix any bugs reported
4. ✅ Add PWA support (manifest.json, Service Worker)
5. ✅ Improve mobile experience
